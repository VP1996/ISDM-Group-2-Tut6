The call management centre (CMC) requires a new and improved system to assist in managing a high traffic of calls from clients. To alleviate the issues and challenges the CMC currently faces, we have brainstormed ideas that may aid these issues. The main problems of the current system include the need to manually divert calls to the appropriate Relationship Managers (RM), resulting in longer wait times on the client end. This eventually leads to poor customer service and experience. Additionally, RM faces the difficulties of completing their tasks and jobs to a high standard, inhibiting them from providing excellent customer service.

For a system to be developed, we had created assumptions based on the case study given to address these issues that the CMC currently face. These assumptions include the following:

1. The CMC for the travel company is relatively large scale/international, and has multiple branches located in different locations;

2. A physical receptionist exists, and was hired to divert inbound calls from customers to the appropriate Relationship Manager;

3. Repeat customers, or customers with benefits have direct contact with their specific Relationship Manager;

4. There are an insufficient number of receptionists to divert the inbound calls, leading to longer waiting times;

5. Phone connections may be or become unstable due to customers’ phone networks;

6. Customer benefits are due to their loyalty or involvement with the company;

7. Postcodes serve as a tool to show the CMC where the call is originating from;

8. Each RM has their own database of repeat customers;

9. If a customer is placed in a waiting room, the system may forget about the active call;

10. Each RM has only one work phone, thus can only work with one customer at one time;

11. If a customer is place in a waiting line and the line become disconnected, the customer loses track of their place in the line;

12. The reception number is the same for the entire company through internet search; and

13. A customer could potentially be redirected to an RM that may not have sufficient knowledge to assist their problems during busier times.

We have brainstormed a possible solution that may aid in the problems the CMC is experiencing. Through the establishment of an online platform, primarily a website, it would be utilised to support the CMC. A physical receptionist would be replaced, resulting in a much quicker and cheaper alternative. This would eventually reduce customer waiting time, and a “call back” system could be implemented to answer urgent questions made by the customers. Additionally, the website will include a Frequently Asked Questions page in order to reduce the number of unnecessary calls from customers with the same enquiry. It is important to emphasise the UX/UI of this website, creating it to be user-friendly to support customers of all ages and backgrounds. As a group, we believe that this idea has the most potential to alleviate the struggles of the CMC and provide great service to the customers that utilise this company for their travelling needs.
