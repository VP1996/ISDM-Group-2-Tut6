# Introduction

# Problem Definition

Clients are encountering an unpleasant experience from contacting a major travel company’s call centre management system due to high traffic of calls and a lack of response. Additionally, Relationship Managers of the call centre management are inhibited from performing their tasks to a high standard, which proves challenging for this travel company. Due to the length of call handling times of clients having to repeat their problem at different stages of their call has consequently led to poor customer service and experience. In order to resolve the problem the call centre management is currently experiencing, there must be an improvement in the already existing information system to assist in communication and operation flow, resulting in a smoother and engaging experience for their customer.

## Objectives

- To potentially solve the issue of customers feeling agitated and hanging up thus providing a solution to the long wait times
- To develop a new online platform to improve customer service satisfaction
- Integrate the online platform alongside the Call Management Centre
- The online platform will primarily be FAQs to allow less inflow of query calls
- Separate different enquiries such as pricing, flights, packages

## Stakeholders
- Customers
- Relationship Managers
- Call routing and distribution

## Point of View Statements

Point Of View (POV) statements were established to help understand the problem. It enabled us to ideate in a goal-oriented matter. The following statements were created:

- As a customer, I feel frustrated that I am put on hold for a long time so I wish my call was redirected instantly to an RM.
- As a customer, I fear that I will lose out on good promotional deals because of me not being made aware about it.
- As a customer, I am anxious about not getting a refund if I miss my flight or trip due to some personal reason.
- As a customer, I don't trust these travel companies as they can be fraud .
- As a customer, I want a response to my inquiry as prompt as possible.
- As a customer, I want to feel valued by the Relationship manager as I am helping them make sales.
- As a Relationship Manager, I don’t want to be verbally abused by the customer so I wish there was a way to alleviate the stress on phone calls
- As a Relationship Manager, I want to maintain a positive, empathetic and professional attitude towards the customers at all times.
- As a Relationship Manager, I want to respond to customer inquiries promptly by acknowledging and resolving customer complaints.
- As a Relationship Manager, I need to know about our products inside and out so that I can answer customer questions efficiently and to the best of my ability.
- As a Relationship Manager, I want to ensure customer satisfaction and provide professional customer support.
- As a Relationship Manager, I want to answer or make calls to clients to learn about and address their needs or other issues with products or services.

From these POV statements made, the following solutions were created:
1. Develop the website to support the call system.
2. Replace the receptionist with a much quicker and cheaper alternative.
3. Reduce the waiting time and implement a  “call back” system. 
4. Implement a FAQ on the website in order to reduce the number or unnecessary calls with the same enquiry.
5. Design a user friendly website.

# Reflection

The call management centre (CMC) requires a new and improved system to assist in managing a high traffic of calls from clients. To alleviate the issues and challenges the CMC currently faces, we have brainstormed ideas that may aid these issues. The main problems of the current system include the need to manually divert calls to the appropriate Relationship Managers (RM), resulting in longer wait times on the client end. This eventually leads to poor customer service and experience. Additionally, RM faces the difficulties of completing their tasks and jobs to a high standard, inhibiting them from providing excellent customer service.

For a system to be developed, we had created assumptions based on the case study given to address these issues that the CMC currently face. These assumptions include the following:

1. The CMC for the travel company is relatively large scale/international, and has multiple branches located in different locations;

2. A physical receptionist exists, and was hired to divert inbound calls from customers to the appropriate Relationship Manager;

3. Repeat customers, or customers with benefits have direct contact with their specific Relationship Manager;

4. There are an insufficient number of receptionists to divert the inbound calls, leading to longer waiting times;

5. Phone connections may be or become unstable due to customers’ phone networks;

6. Customer benefits are due to their loyalty or involvement with the company;

7. Postcodes serve as a tool to show the CMC where the call is originating from;

8. Each RM has their own database of repeat customers;

9. If a customer is placed in a waiting room, the system may forget about the active call;

10. Each RM has only one work phone, thus can only work with one customer at one time;

11. If a customer is place in a waiting line and the line become disconnected, the customer loses track of their place in the line;

12. The reception number is the same for the entire company through internet search; and

13. A customer could potentially be redirected to an RM that may not have sufficient knowledge to assist their problems during busier times.

We have brainstormed a possible solution that may aid in the problems the CMC is experiencing. Through the establishment of an online platform, primarily a website, it would be utilised to support the CMC. A physical receptionist would be replaced, resulting in a much quicker and cheaper alternative. This would eventually reduce customer waiting time, and a “call back” system could be implemented to answer urgent questions made by the customers. Additionally, the website will include a Frequently Asked Questions page in order to reduce the number of unnecessary calls from customers with the same enquiry. It is important to emphasise the UX/UI of this website, creating it to be user-friendly to support customers of all ages and backgrounds. As a group, we believe that this idea has the most potential to alleviate the struggles of the CMC and provide great service to the customers that utilise this company for their travelling needs.

### Summary of Diagrams
In reference to the diagrams above, the new system provides more features for the customers and relationship managers. A receptionist is no longer required due to all processes occuring online, and all connections will happen automatically. After accessing the website, the customers will be able to access FAQ which will be continuously updated by the Software Administrator or the company managers. It will include all repetitive questions and issues that customers had in the past. Futhermore, the website will allow the users to call if their enquiry is unable to be solved via the website.

By calling through the online platform, the user will be automatically redirected to the next available Relationship Manager. However, if all the managers are busy, the user will be placed on the waiting room. Each page will have a specific ID and will display the customers approximate time of waiting. The customer may request a call back if they choose not to wait.  The user will be redirected to a new page where they will be able to leave their full name, email, phone number and issue. An available manager will receive the request and call the customer back. 

Moreover, once the customer chooses to call via the online platform, they will be able to register on the website. All calls will be saved within their history, and the system will remember which manager they talked to. Therefore, the next time the customer will have an issue, they will be able to login and request a call from a previously contacted relationship manager.
