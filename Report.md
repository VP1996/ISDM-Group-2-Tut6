# Problem Definition

Clients are encountering an unpleasant experience from contacting a major travel company’s call management centre (CMC) system due to high traffic of calls leading to a lack of response. Additionally, Relationship Managers (RM) of the CMC are inhibited from performing their tasks to a high standard, which proves challenging for this travel company. Due to the length of call handling times of clients having to repeat their problem at different stages of their call has consequently led to poor customer service and experience. In order to resolve the problem the CMC  is currently experiencing, there must be an improvement in the already existing information system to assist in communication and operation flow, resulting in a smoother and engaging experience for their customer.

## Objectives

- To solve the issue of customers feeling agitated and hanging up thus providing a solution to the long wait times
- To develop a new online platform to improve customer service satisfaction
- Integrate the online platform alongside the CMC
- The online platform will primarily be FAQs to allow less inflow of query calls
- Separate different enquiries such as pricing, flights, packages

## Point of View Statements

Point Of View (POV) statements were established as a part of the Design Thinking Process to help understand the problem. It enabled us to ideate in a goal-oriented matter. The following statements were created:

### Customer POV:

- "I feel frustrated that I am put on hold for a long time, I wish I could be redirected instantly to a Relationship Manager. Being put on hold makes me fear that I will miss out on good promotional deals because I haven't been informed about them. I also want a prompt response to my inquiry so I don't have to keep thinking about my concerns."

- "I think about the legitimacy of this travel company because it could possiblly be fraud. I get anxious when I'm put on hold for a while and don't get an instant response. What if I don't get my refund from my missed flight due to an injury or some other personal reason? I want to feel valued by the Relationship Manager as I am making their sales."

### Relationship Manager POV:

- "I try to maintain a positive, empathetic and professional attitude towards customer at all times but sometimes it can get hard. I don't want to be verbally abused by customers due to long delays. I wish there was a way to alleviate stress on incoming phone calls or at least be able to answer customer's questions efficiently and to the best of my ability."

- "I am aware about the products and services that our company sells, but I should know them inside and out. It would really help with responding to customer inquiries promptly by acknowledging and resolving customer complaints. Also, instead of having customers wait in a call queue, I want to answer and be able to make calls back to the clients to address their needs or other issues with our products or services."


## How Might We Statements
How Might We (HMW) statements were also developed to brainstorm new ideas and address opportunities.

- How might we improve the overall quality of the system? 
  - Develop the website to support the call system and replace the receptionist with a much quicker and cheaper alternative.
- How might we reduce the waiting time?
  - Implement a “call back” system and FAQ for the company.
- How might we improve our customers' trust for our company?
  - Design a user friendly website and make it more professional and interactive.
  
## Possible Solutions

1. Develop the website to support the call system
2. Replace the receptionist with a much quicker and cheaper alternative.
3. Reduce the waiting time and implement a  “call back” system. 
4. Implement a FAQ on the website in order to reduce the number or unnecessary calls with the same enquiry.
5. Design a user friendly website.  

# Reflection

The CMC requires a new and improved system to assist in managing a high traffic of calls from clients. To alleviate the issues and challenges the CMC currently faces, we have brainstormed ideas that may aid these issues. The main problems of the current system include the need to manually divert calls to the appropriate RMs, resulting in longer wait times on the client end. This eventually leads to poor customer service and experience. Additionally, RM faces the difficulties of completing their tasks and jobs to a high standard, inhibiting them from providing excellent customer service.

For a system to be developed, we had created assumptions based on the case study given to address these issues that the CMC currently face. These assumptions include the following:

1. The CMC for the travel company is relatively large scale/international, and has multiple branches located in different locations;

2. A physical receptionist exists, and was hired to divert inbound calls from customers to the appropriate RM;

3. Repeat customers, or customers with benefits have direct contact with their specific RM;

4. There are an insufficient number of receptionists to divert the inbound calls, leading to longer waiting times;

5. Phone connections may be or become unstable due to customers’ phone networks;

6. Customer benefits are due to their loyalty or involvement with the company;

7. Postcodes serve as a tool to show the CMC where the call is originating from;

8. Each RM has their own database of repeat customers;

9. If a customer is placed in a waiting room, the system may forget about the active call;

10. Each RM has only one work phone, thus can only work with one customer at one time;

11. If a customer is place in a waiting line and the line become disconnected, the customer loses track of their place in the line;

12. The reception number is the same for the entire company through internet search; and

13. A customer could potentially be redirected to an RM that may not have sufficient knowledge to assist their problems during busier times.

We have brainstormed a possible solution through the Design Thinking Process that may aid in the problems the CMC is experiencing. By creating empathy maps, POV statements and HMW statements, we were able to define and understand the stakeholder's problem. Through the establishment of an online platform, it would be utilised to support the CMC. A physical receptionist would be replaced, resulting in a much quicker and cheaper alternative. This would eventually reduce customer waiting time, and a “call back” system could be implemented to answer urgent questions made by the customers. Additionally, the website will include a FAQ page in order to reduce the number of unnecessary calls from customers with the same enquiry. It is important to emphasise the UX/UI of this website, creating it to be user-friendly to support customers of all ages and backgrounds. As a group, we believe that this idea has the most potential to alleviate the struggles of the CMC and provide great service to the customers that utilise this company for their travelling needs.

### Summary of Diagrams
In reference to the diagrams above, the new system provides more features for the customers and RMs. A receptionist is no longer required due to all processes occurring online and all connections happening automatically. After accessing the website, the customers will be able to access an FAQ page which will be continuously updated by the Software Administrator or the company managers. Furthermore, the website will allow the users to call if their enquiry is unable to be solved via the online platform.

By calling through the online platform, the user will be automatically redirected to the next available RM. However, if all the managers are busy, the user will be placed within a waiting room. The waiting room will assign a specific ID for the customer's call and will display to the customers their approximate time of waiting. The customer may request a call back if they choose not to wait. The user will be redirected to a new page where they will be able to leave their full name, email, phone number and issue. An available manager will receive the request and eventually call the customer back.

Once the customer chooses to call via the online platform, they will be able to register to the website. All calls will be saved within their history and the system will remember which manager they had previously talked to. This will allow the customer to login and request a call from their previously contacted RM.

# Competitive Advantages and Possible Effects if the Project Fails

## Advantages

By analysing the issues and systematic concerns of the current way the CMC has been working, it is made evident that an upgrade to the system is essential. As a team, we had created a new web platform and developed ways in which the current issues could be eradicated. This would not only make the CMC more effective; it would also allow customers to feel more satisfied with their experience or purchase. Converting this company’s current call management system to a website has been deemed a much more time saving and an efficient option. This website will allow customers to gain answers to their common questions without having to constantly call the CMC and wait to be connected to an available RM. This option will serve a wide age group of clients as it will allow the aging population to call and connect with an RM directly whilst also providing the younger generation with a just quick popup live chat option to get their queries answered on the go.

For time-conscious customers, a newly added feature of requesting a call back will also be provided. This can be used to assist the customer to stay in the queue without losing their position. This will ensure that the customer feels valued for their time and will also lower the pressure on the CMCs system to help the network flow process smoother.

Having a proper login and register feature will provide clients with more convenience in regard to tracking their previous product purchase or specific RM call details. This option will allow the customers to feel more protected in terms of their data being saved securely, which will only be allowed access with the login feature. Furthermore, this will allow only the customer with an account to get special access to prior customer feedback allowing the customers to view the businesses transparency and their values and morals towards their customer service. Customers repetitively seeing good reviews from previous clients will allow the business to grow their customer service base due to new customers wanting to buy their travel package, ultimately growing the company's profit.


## Possible Effects

Through the development of the new call system for the travelling company, we outlined several benefits in the above section. However, we also need to list the possible damages that the new system may cause to the company and overall processes. As our new system will be based online, our business would be dependent of servers and energy and assume that this system will be capable of running 24/7. It is essential to monitor the system regularly as the servers may contain bugs due to overload, wrong programming or cyber-attacks.

The development of the website will require software developers and programmers to set up the system and later monitor and improve it. This will consequently cause the company to spend additional money on workers and supplementary spaces for servers. We can assume that if the travel company is significant in size, the reduction of receptionists and the buildings they work in can be converted into additional server rooms. In order to save some personnel, the company may introduce new positions of developers and programmers and if the receptionist has appropriate qualifications they may the newly available job.

Creating an online system may consequently lead to a layoff of all existing/physical receptionists. There would no longer be a need for receptionists due to customers being able to connect with RMs through the online platform. Furthermore, the website's database will contain all history and documentation online. Although the company does not specify how many pre-existing receptionists they currently have employed, we can assume that the employees may feel anger at the company due to the layoff. These receptionists could resultantly file a complaint, resulting in the company to spend more money. However, it is beneficial to switch to a web-based system as it is more efficient in the long-term run than to rely on human working conditions. There is a significant possibility of running our system parallel to the CMC's existing system, therefore there would be no need to dismiss existing receptionists. By taking this option of implementing our web-based solution with the current CMC's system, there would be a lower impact on the business, securing receptionists positions.
