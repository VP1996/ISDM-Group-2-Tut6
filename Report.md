# Problem Definition

Clients are encountering an unpleasant experience from contacting a major travel company’s call centre management system due to high traffic of calls leading to a lack of response. Additionally, Relationship Managers of the call centre management are inhibited from performing their tasks to a high standard, which proves challenging for this travel company. Due to the length of call handling times of clients having to repeat their problem at different stages of their call has consequently led to poor customer service and experience. In order to resolve the problem the call centre management is currently experiencing, there must be an improvement in the already existing information system to assist in communication and operation flow, resulting in a smoother and engaging experience for their customer.

## Objectives

- To solve the issue of customers feeling agitated and hanging up thus providing a solution to the long wait times
- To develop a new online platform to improve customer service satisfaction
- Integrate the online platform alongside the Call Management Centre
- The online platform will primarily be FAQs to allow less inflow of query calls
- Separate different enquiries such as pricing, flights, packages

## Stakeholders
- Customers
- Relationship Managers
- Call routing and distribution

## Point of View Statements

Point Of View (POV) statements were established as a part of the Design Thinking Process to help understand the problem. It enabled us to ideate in a goal-oriented matter. The following statements were created:

### Customer POV:

- "I feel frustrated that I am put on hold for a long time, I wish I could be redirected instantly to a Relationship Manager. Being put on hold makes me fear that I will miss out on good promotional deals because I haven't been informed about them. I also want a prompt response to my inquiry so I don't have to keep thinking about my concerns."

- "I think about the legitimacy of this travel company because it could possiblly be fraud. I get anxious when I'm put on hold for a while and don't get an instant response. What if I don't get my refund from my missed flight due to an injury or some other personal reason? I want to feel valued by the Relationship Manager as I am afterall, making their sales."

### Relationship Manager POV:

- "I try to maintain a positive, empathetic and professional attitude towards customer at all times but sometimes it can get hard. I don't want to be verbally abused by customers due to long delays. I wish there was a way to alleviate stress on incoming phone calls or at least be able to answer customer's questions efficiently and to the best of my ability."

- "I am aware about the products and services that our company sells, but I should know them inside and out. It would really help with responding to customer inquiries promptly by acknowledging and resolving customer complaints. Also, instead of having customers wait in a call queue, I want to answer and be able to make calls back to the clients to address their needs or other issues with our products or services. "

### From these POV statements made, the following solutions were created:

1. Develop the website to support the call system.

2. Replace the receptionist with a much quicker and cheaper alternative.

3. Reduce the waiting time and implement a  “call back” system. 

4. Implement a FAQ on the website in order to reduce the number or unnecessary calls with the same enquiry.

5. Design a user friendly website.

# Reflection

The call management centre (CMC) requires a new and improved system to assist in managing a high traffic of calls from clients. To alleviate the issues and challenges the CMC currently faces, we have brainstormed ideas that may aid these issues. The main problems of the current system include the need to manually divert calls to the appropriate Relationship Managers (RM), resulting in longer wait times on the client end. This eventually leads to poor customer service and experience. Additionally, RM faces the difficulties of completing their tasks and jobs to a high standard, inhibiting them from providing excellent customer service.

For a system to be developed, we had created assumptions based on the case study given to address these issues that the CMC currently face. These assumptions include the following:

1. The CMC for the travel company is relatively large scale/international, and has multiple branches located in different locations;

2. A physical receptionist exists, and was hired to divert inbound calls from customers to the appropriate Relationship Manager;

3. Repeat customers, or customers with benefits have direct contact with their specific Relationship Manager;

4. There are an insufficient number of receptionists to divert the inbound calls, leading to longer waiting times;

5. Phone connections may be or become unstable due to customers’ phone networks;

6. Customer benefits are due to their loyalty or involvement with the company;

7. Postcodes serve as a tool to show the CMC where the call is originating from;

8. Each RM has their own database of repeat customers;

9. If a customer is placed in a waiting room, the system may forget about the active call;

10. Each RM has only one work phone, thus can only work with one customer at one time;

11. If a customer is place in a waiting line and the line become disconnected, the customer loses track of their place in the line;

12. The reception number is the same for the entire company through internet search; and

13. A customer could potentially be redirected to an RM that may not have sufficient knowledge to assist their problems during busier times.

We have brainstormed a possible solution that may aid in the problems the CMC is experiencing. Through the establishment of an online platform, primarily a website, it would be utilised to support the CMC. A physical receptionist would be replaced, resulting in a much quicker and cheaper alternative. This would eventually reduce customer waiting time, and a “call back” system could be implemented to answer urgent questions made by the customers. Additionally, the website will include a Frequently Asked Questions page in order to reduce the number of unnecessary calls from customers with the same enquiry. It is important to emphasise the UX/UI of this website, creating it to be user-friendly to support customers of all ages and backgrounds. As a group, we believe that this idea has the most potential to alleviate the struggles of the CMC and provide great service to the customers that utilise this company for their travelling needs.

### Summary of Diagrams
In reference to the diagrams above, the new system provides more features for the customers and relationship managers. A receptionist is no longer required due to all processes occurring online and all connections happening automatically. After accessing the website, the customers will be able to access an FAQ page which will be continuously updated by the Software Administrator or the company managers. It will include all repetitive questions and issues that customers have faced previously. Furthermore, the website will allow the users to call if their enquiry is unable to be solved via the online platform.

By calling through the online platform, the user will be automatically redirected to the next available Relationship Manager. However, if all the managers are busy, the user will be placed within a waiting room. The waiting room will assign a specific ID for the customer's call and will display to the customers their approximate time of waiting. The customer may request a call back if they choose not to wait.  The user will be redirected to a new page where they will be able to leave their full name, email, phone number and issue. An available manager will receive the request and eventually call the customer back. 

Once the customer chooses to call via the online platform, they will be able to register to the website. All calls will be saved within their history and the system will remember which manager they had previously talked to. This will allow the customer to login and request a call from their previously contacted Relationship Manager.

# Competitive Advantages and Possible Effects if the Project Fails

## Advantages

Analysing the issues and systematic concerns of the current way the call centre management has been working, an upgrade to the system is essential. As a team, we had created a new platform, and ways in which the current issues could be eradicated. This would not only make the Call centre management more effective; it would also allow customers to feel more satisfied with their experience or purchase. We had all concluded that implementing a website would be a very efficient way to handle the excessive queries. This would allow any customer to have their queries solved.
Converting this company’s current call management system to a website has been deemed as a much more time saving and as an efficient option. As this website will allow the customers to easily get answers to their simple questions which are very common without having to always call the company and wait for their turn to be connected to an available RM. This option will be a perfect solutions towards serving a wide age group of clients as it will allowed the aged population a call and get connected to an RM directly service whilst also providing the young generation with a just quick popup Live chat options to get their queries answered on the go or look through various Q/A without having to waste their time.

With FAQ, the customers will no longer need to contact the managers for any small issues. As a result, it will lower the pressure on the manager by providing more free time for customers with more unique issues. Moreover, the customer will no longer need to wait for a response and waste their time on the call. They will get their issue solved or get some clarification on the go.
Rather than having a regular waiting time option found in current call systems with just music playing throughout , in this website a new form of waiting time experience will be provided to the customer where the amount of waiting time remaining for one’s certain call to be processed will be constantly updated in order to keep them informed rather than kept clueless. For time conscious customers a newly added feature of requesting a call back will also be provided which can be used which will help the customer to be in line for the call without losing their spot . This will make the customer feel valued for their time by the company and will also lower the pressure on the system helping the network flow to be smoother.

The request for a call back feature either from any random or a specific RM  will allow the customer to be freed from the waiting time without losing their spot. This feature will be beneficial to both the party’s as it will not make the call line busy/ interrupted due to multiple customers waiting. Having  this additional feature to develop an improved call system will help everyone save time, lower receptionist hiring cost, will cater to multiple customers at the same time and will make the company look more professional and trustworthy.
Having a proper Login/ Register facility will provide clients with more convenience in regard to tracking their  previous product purchase or specific RM Call Details handling their case personally. This option will allow the customers to feel more protected in terms of their data being saved securely which will be allowed access only with the login system. The feature will also allow only the customer with an account to get special access to prior customers feedback allowing the business to look more transparent and reflect their values and morals towards their customer service.

Access to customers' reviews in terms of their prior service experience will help the future clients to understand the business better and will help them to build their trust about the business. This will also help the client to get a better understanding about the type of products and services the company offers. Customers repetitively seeing good reviews from the previous clients of the business will allow the company to grow their customer base due to new customers wanting to buy their travel packages and will ultimately help grow the organisation's profit.

## Possible Effects

Through the development of the new call system for the travelling company, we outlined several benefits in the above paragraph. However, we also need to list the possible damages that the new system may cause to the company and overall processes. First of all, as our product will be based online, we can say that it would depend on the servers and energy and that it should be working 24/7. As a result, the servers may have some bugs due to overload, wrong programming or cyber attack. It is essential to monitor the system regularly. 

Another issue that might cause trouble for a company is the layoff of all the receptionists. As our system would allow the customers to connect with the managers through a website and will have all the history and documentation online, there is no need for receptionists. Although the company doesn't specify how many receptionists they have, we can assume that the employees may feel angry at the company and could file a complaint, that could result in spending more money. However, switching to a web system is more efficient in the long term, rather than rely on human conditions. Moreover, our system could be working together with the receptionists if the company will decide to use it. It could lower the impact and secure some positions for the receptionists.

The website development will require the software developers and programmer to set up the system and later monitor and improve it. It will cause the company to spend more money on the workers and additional spaces for servers. However, the company doesn't specify the size of the current system. As a result, we can assume that if the travelling company is large, after reducing the size of receptionists, some buildings can be converted into server rooms. Moreover, in order to save some personnel, the company may introduce the new position of the developer and programmer. If the receptionist has qualifications, he may try a new job.
