#### Problem definition:

Clients are encountering an unpleasant experience from contacting a major travel company’s call center management system due to high traffic of calls and a lack of response. Additionally, Relationship Managers of the call center management are inhibited from performing their tasks to a high standard, which proves challenging for this travel company. Due to the length of call handling times of clients having to repeat their problem at different stages of their call has consequently led to poor customer service and experience. In order to resolve the problem the call center management is currently experiencing, there must be an improvement in the already existing information system to assist in communication and operation flow, resulting in a smoother and engaging experience for their customer.

#### Objectives:

- To potentially solve the issue of customers feeling agitated and hanging up (providing a solution to the long wait times)
- To develop a whole new customer service system
-- Implement an online platform alongside the call center management
-- Live chat option
-- To create an appointment schedule system (Where customers book an appointment in advance and receive a call from the RM’s at their selected time)
-- Separate different enquiries (Pricing, Flights, Packages)
-- FAQ Page will allow less inflow of queries

#### Possible extra feature:

- Transferring inbound calls takes a lot of time. By setting up PABX (Private Automatic Branch Exchange - automatic telephone switching system) with different numbers for different departments.
