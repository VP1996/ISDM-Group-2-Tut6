#### Assumptions

- Call Centre Company is relatively large scale/international with branches in different locations.
- A physical receptionist was hired to assort the inbound calls from the customers to the correct Relationship Manager.
- The customers with benefits or repeat customers have a direct contact with their specific manager.
- Insufficient receptionists to divert the inbound calls, which led to longer waiting times.
- The phone connection may be not stable due to customers' phone networks. 
- We assume that some customers have benefits due to their involvement in the company.
- Customers with most sales made from the company get special treatment for their loyalty.
- The postcodes serve as a tool that shows the company where the call is coming from.
- Each manager has their own database of their repeat customers.
- When the customer is placed on the waiting rooms the system might forget about them.
- Each manager has only 1 work phone.
- If the customer is in the waiting line for a long time and the line gets cut, they lose track of their place in the line.
- The reception number is the same for the entire company on the internet search. 
- During busy times, a customer could potentially be redirected to an RM that may not have sufficient knowledge to be able to solve their problems.
- Prior to starting the role, each RM is required to complete a questionnaire to align their knowledge with the company requirements. It is assumed they provide truthful information throughout the entirety of the questionnaire.
