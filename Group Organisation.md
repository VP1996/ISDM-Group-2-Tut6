# Group Organisation and Processes

We approached this assignment utilising the agile method. Our group had elected for 2 meetings to occur per week - Mondays and Fridays. Tasks were assigned during Monday's tutorial, and was completed by the following Friday. During the Monday class, we took the oppotunity to approach our tutor to ask any questions that we had and assigned tasks to work on either individually or collaboratively. By Friday, we were to complete these tasks ready to upload our work to GitHub. To assist us with planning, we used the in built 'Project' tool by GitHub. For this project to be completed, we had four sprints. This ensured that the project maintained quality. An example can be found below:

A backlog was created through the "Issues" component of GitHub, providing a prioritised list of actionable items for our team to work on. With a backlog created, our group knew that there was sets of incoming tasks which kept the development moving forward.

To achieve a consistent workflow, we had come up with the idea to create folders within our repository under 'Weekly Work' which contains each week's content and completed work. During our Friday meetings, we would upload and commit our work into the corresponding folder. We contacted each other via Discord, which we deemed to be the most suitable software for us to collaborate. We also held sprint reviews to discuss what we could improve on for next sprint and to push any work that wasn't completed in the week to the backlog to complete it during the next sprint.

It is also important that we acknowledge the Design Thinking Process as it helped us establish a feasible and practical solution to our problem. We were able to gain an empathetic understanding of the problem through empathy maps, Point of View and How Might We statements. This enabled us to create possivle ideas that we thought could alleviate the problems the call centre management was experiencing. A prototype that we deem most suitable to solve our problem was created in hope to increase customer satisfaction, relationship managers well-being and company profits.

Throughout this project, we have learnt the significance of teamwork and by having 6 of us in a group, it provided more resources for problem solving. Most importantly, however, it motivated us to cooperate and be supportive of one another allowing us to achieving the goal of completing this project.
