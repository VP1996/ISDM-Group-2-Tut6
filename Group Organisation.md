# Group Organisation and Processes

## Agile Method
We approached this assignment utilising the agile method. Our group had elected for 2 meetings to occur per week - Mondays and Fridays. Tasks were assigned during Monday's tutorial, and was completed by the following Friday. During the Monday class, we took the oppotunity to approach our tutor to ask any questions that we had and assigned tasks to work on either individually or collaboratively. By Friday, we were to complete these tasks ready to upload our work to GitHub. To assist us with planning, we used the in built 'Project' tool by GitHub. For this project to be completed, we had four sprints. This ensured that the project maintained quality. An example can be found below:

A backlog was created through the "Issues" component of GitHub, providing a prioritised list of actionable items for our team to work on. With a backlog created, our group knew that there was sets of incoming tasks which kept the development moving forward.

To achieve a consistent workflow, we had come up with the idea to create folders within our repository under 'Weekly Work' which contains folders of each week's content and completed work. On our Friday meetings, we would upload and commit our work into the corresponding folder. We also held sprint reviews to discuss what we could improve on for next sprint, and to push any work that wasn't completed in the week to the backlog to complete it during the next sprint.
